# Neon Drift
## Cyberpunk Racing — PC & Console

Neon Drift is a high-speed cyberpunk racing game blending arcade handling with deep vehicle tuning. Players race through neon-soaked cityscapes and take part in challenge events and time attacks.

The single-player campaign mixes narrative beats with race leagues; rival crews, city districts, and unlockable upgrades shape progression. Races alternate between street circuits and open highways where traffic and weather affect handling.

Multiplayer supports competitive splitscreen and online matchmaking with ranked ladders. Community-created events and seasonal content keep the meta fresh and reward cosmetic and performance upgrades.

The development emphasis is on stylized lighting, synthwave soundtrack, and responsive controls suitable for both controllers and keyboard. Mod support allows custom tracks and ship skins in the community hub.

System requirements are moderate; the game scales across PC and consoles with dynamic resolution and graphical presets to keep frame rates high.

# Starfall RPG
## Sci‑Fi Action RPG — Space Exploration & Combat

Starfall RPG sends players across a shattered star system to reclaim lost colonies, fight pirates, and reveal a hidden AI conspiracy. It combines ship combat with on-foot mission gameplay.

The story-driven campaign features branching quests, NPC factions, and moral choices that affect alliances and endings. Players can upgrade their ship and gear, recruit crew, and modify abilities as they progress.

Exploration is rewarded: derelict stations, procedurally seeded side missions, and planetary ruins provide resources and lore. The game balances scripted narrative moments with emergent sandbox encounters.

Combat mixes tactical ship battles and fast-paced third-person skirmishes. Each class has unique skill trees and weapon archetypes, encouraging varied playstyles and team synergies in co-op.

Performance and accessibility options target consoles and mid-range PCs. A robust options menu covers control remapping, subtitles, and scalable graphic presets.
